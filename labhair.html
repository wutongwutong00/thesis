        <div id="bigP" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; margin: auto;">
            <div id="smallP" style="height: 100px; width: 50px; margin: 2%; padding: 2em;">The skin and it’s “appendages” like oil glands and hair follicles which make up hair transplant grafts are so immunologically active that using excised follicles from a 3rd party and transplanting them into a different recipient would result in the follicles being immediately rejected.  They would not take root properly or be accepted by the recipient body, and therefore the hair transplant would fail.
                <div id="smallP" style="height: 20px; width: 50px; margin: 5%; padding: 2em;">Basically, hair from someone else contains all sorts of receptors and proteins on the cells and therefore is seen by the body as an invader or something that your immune system needs to attack and destroy. The only time a transplant between 2 different people would work is if you had an identical twin willing to lend you some hair.
                    <p id="smallP" style="height: 250px; width: 450px; margin: 10%; float: right; padding: 2em;">If one sibling is balding or thinning, the identical twin has the same genetics and therefore would be balding too. If you could use a non-identical donor you would still want a donor with the exact same type of hair as you, not to mention the same pigmentation, etc., which could be a tough thing to match up. This is why current hair transplants are primarily performed by taking donor hair from other areas and moved to recipient’s scalp. Those follicles are essentially just moved from one area of the scalp to another, which the body allows with great success.</p>

        <div id="bigP" style="height:20px; width: 200px;">
            <div id="smallP">Growing hair follicles in a lab has proven to be very difficult because of the requirements needed to grow them outside of the body.
                <p id="smallP">Because of the way the hair follicle cells develop, it is an intricate and elusive interaction between the epidermal layer of skin (the ectoderm) and the connective tissue layer below, known as the mesenchyme, along with highly specialized melanocytes that still mystifies scientists. So far it’s been impossible to complete understand, let alone reproduce that interaction in a lab setting. But, researchers are getting closer to figuring out how to duplicate this interaction. Recently they were then able to take that information and grow embryotic organoid hair follicles that eventually turned into 3mm long “follicloids.” The researchers refer to them as “organioids” and “follicloids” because these artificially grown tissues but resemble organs and follicles.</p>

        <div id="smallP" style="height: 50px; width: 10px; padding:1em; position: absolute; right: 10%;">
                <p id="smallP" style="height: 50px; width: 10px; padding:1em; float: right; margin: 1em;">It took about 23 days for the researchers to grow the 3mm hair follicle that could then be transplanted into the mice. These researchers were also able to study the follicles and improved their success rate to almost 100%. Meaning that they can now almost perfectly grow new hair follicles every time they repeat the experiment. They are also beginning to figure out how to modify the follicles to adjust the pigmentation or color of the hair.</p>
                After the hair follicles were grown in the petri dishes, away from the mice, they were able to be transplanted into the mice where they continued to thrive. The transplanted follicles were shown to survive and grow through multiple hair growth cycles. This means that the lab grown hair follicles were able to be implanted into the mice, were accepted by the recipient and continued to thrive as if they were naturally grown hair from the mouse.
